### New Features

- âŒ— Introducing new layout options for Streamlit! Move aside, vertical layout.
Make a little space for... horizontal layout! Check out our
[blog post](https://www.npmjs.com/package/streamlit-component-lib).
- ðŸ’¾ File uploader blurb


### Notable Changes

- ðŸš¨ Breaking Change: Following the deprecation of `st.deck_gl_chart` in January 2020, we have
now removed the API completely. Please use `st.pydeck_chart` instead.
- ðŸŽˆ `st.balloon` has gotten a facelift with nicer balloons and smoother animations.
